### [Tempo Weather](https://twitter.com/tempoweather) (iOS, 2013)

My first app published to the store. At it's peak it reached 10,000 downloads a day, re-gained in popularity when I added watchOS support on day 1 of the Apple Watch being available.

### [Chelsea FC Hospitality](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/chelsea-fc-hospitality/id751451886) (iOS, 2014)

Worked closely with Chelsea FC to deliver an app to compliment their matchdays. Interesting project that shifted state based on real-time events (pre-match, during match, half time, post-match).

### [Can't Help My Selfie for FCUK](https://vimeo.com/94516759) (macOS, 2014)
I was the lead developer for the macOS app that was hooked-up to an array of webcams which registered people's votes for a look that appears in the window display. 

### [Interactive Window Catalogue for Finery](https://vimeo.com/118485213) (macOS, 2015)
Built a macOS app to interact with a product catalogue through the window using a Magic Leap.

### [Feelix](https://artgym.com/what-if-we-could-picture-how-the-world-feels/) (iOS, 2015)
Charming app that used the camera to help you capture daily images and assign emotions and colours to them. All displayed in an Instagram-like feed.

### [Football Whispers]({{site.url}}/assets/videos/football_whispers/football_whispers.mp4) (iOS, 2016)
I designed and developed the app that took advantage of most corners of iOS at the time, including haptics, 3D Touch and rich push notifications, all wrapped up in a very native-feeling experience.

### [Easy Sleep Tracker](https://www.noactivityapp.com) (iOS, 2018)
My own app that I designed and developed to help you automatically track your sleep based on large periods of inactivity (like your watch being on your nightstand).

### [Drest](https://www.drest.com) (iOS, 2019)
My current employer where I spend most of time leading the Core team, but still manage to contribute to the codebase that I started over 2 years ago.
